# Mobile-first CSS (with SASS or LESS)
A sassy little demo project

Feel free to use this as a starter to get you on the right track with writing mobile-first styles with SASS.

## The rules:
1. Start with all yout styles for mobile and then add min-width and/or landscape media queries for wider screens as required (never max-width or portrait)
2. All media queries belong in your top-level .scss or .less file (never in partials). Nest your partial imports within these top-level media queries.
