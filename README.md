# Mobile-first CSS (with SASS)

Feel free to use this as a starter to get you on the right track with writing mobile-first styles with SASS.

## The rules:
1. Start with just the styles you need for mobile
2. Find natural `min-width` breakpoints to suit your design
3. Put all the media queries in the top-level .sass or .less file
4. Progressively add partials for larger screens as required
